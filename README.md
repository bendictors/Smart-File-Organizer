## 💡 What is Smart File Organizer Pro?

**Smart File Organizer Pro** is a collaborative file and project management Add-on built for Adobe Express. Designed to address Express’s current solo-user limitations, it allows users to create structured project folders, invite teammates or clients, assign specific roles, and manage permissions — all within the Express workspace. It’s not just a feature — it’s a lightweight, mini web app that launches directly in the Express Add-ons panel and brings structure, clarity, and team coordination into a traditionally individual design space..

### Core Features:
- ✅ Create and manage projects inside Adobe Express  
- ✅ Assign roles: Manager, Designer, or Client  
- ✅ Comment on files and collaborate across teams  
- ✅ Track file status and version history  
- ✅ Built for teams, freelancers, educators, and SMBs


### What It Solves

Adobe Express users often face chaos when managing multiple files or collaborating with others. There’s no true folder hierarchy, no way to assign team roles, and feedback typically happens outside the tool — via emails, Google Docs, or screenshots. This Add-on solves those real, recurring pain points. Teams can now group files under shared folders, assign SmartTags for fast filtering, and control who sees what using role-based permissions. It replaces scattered workflows with one centralized system, improving productivity and accountability without ever leaving Adobe Express.


### How It Works

Once launched from the Express Add-ons menu, users arrive at a dashboard that presents all of their folders, recent files, and project areas at a glance. They can quickly start by importing existing assets or creating a new folder for a campaign or client. Using SmartTags, they can label files — such as “Video Content,” “Client A,” or “Q4 Marketing” — for easy navigation. From there, users can head into the People & Roles section, where they invite collaborators by email and assign them a role: Manager, Designer, or Client. Each role unlocks a different level of access — managers have full control, designers can create and comment, while clients can only view and leave feedback.


### Who It’s For
Smart File Organizer Pro is ideal for design agencies, freelance designers, content creators, marketing teams, and educators — anyone working with assets across multiple clients, campaigns, or collaborators. It’s especially valuable for professionals who already use Express to create content but need a better way to organize and deliver it collaboratively. This is not just for big teams — even solo users with several clients will benefit from clear file grouping, feedback control, and smarter organization.
