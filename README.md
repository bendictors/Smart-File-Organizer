## 💡 What is Smart File Organizer Pro?

**Smart File Organizer Pro** is a collaborative file and project management Add-on built for Adobe Express. Designed to address Express’s current solo-user limitations, it allows users to create structured project folders, invite teammates or clients, assign specific roles, and manage permissions — all within the Express workspace. It’s not just a feature — it’s a lightweight, mini web app that launches directly in the Express Add-ons panel and brings structure, clarity, and team coordination into a traditionally individual design space..

### Core Features:
- ✅ Create and manage projects inside Adobe Express  
- ✅ Assign roles: Manager, Designer, or Client  
- ✅ Comment on files and collaborate across teams  
- ✅ Track file status and version history  
- ✅ Built for teams, freelancers, educators, and SMBs
